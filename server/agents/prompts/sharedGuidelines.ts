Project T1 Shared Evaluation Guidelines:
1. Fidelity — Preserve the source meaning and key imagery. Avoid mistranslation, omissions, or additions.
2. Fluency — Produce natural, grammatically solid English that reads as authored, not machine-like.
3. Literary Style — Retain the author’s voice, register, and rhythm while keeping figurative language vivid.
4. Cultural Resonance — Localize cultural references with unobtrusive context so target readers grasp intent.
5. Creative Autonomy — Only deviate from literal renderings when it clarifies imagery or voice; note rationale for larger rewrites.
Across all judgments:
- Prefer precise vocabulary over generic phrasing.
- Keep tone balanced; avoid melodrama or flattening the emotional contour.
- When recommending edits, explain the reasoning briefly and supply before/after text where applicable.
